      <div class="desc"><h1>General Info</h1> <p>Hoth was a remote, icy planet that was the sixth planet in the star system of the same name.
         It notably hosted Echo Base, the temporary headquarters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, until the Galactic Empire located the Rebels,
          initiating a major confrontation known as the Battle of Hoth. From space, the planet of Hoth looked like a pale blue orb due to its dense snow and ice covering. Five planets existed between Hoth and its sun, while an asteroid belt surrounded the planet with meteors occasionally striking the surface. Its surface was covered with glaciers and frozen ice plains. The temperature, although always frigid, was known to drop to -60°C come nightfall. Although devoid of intelligent life, Hoth was home to fifteen species of large gray snow lizards called tauntauns and to a species of towering predators known as wampas.</p> <p>Source: Wookiepedia</p></div>

      <div class="desc"><h1>Environment</h1> <p>The seasons of Hoth are the most Earth-like, due to the
        similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Hothian seasons are about four times those of Earth's because Hoth's greater
         distance from the Sun leads to the Hothian year being about four Earth years long. Hothian surface temperatures vary from lows of about -240
          °C (−245 °F) at the winter polar caps to highs of up to 3 °C (85 °F) in equatorial summer. The wide range in temperatures is due
          to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure, and the low thermal inertia of Martian soil.
           The planet is 5 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 23% of the amount of sunlight.</p> <p>Source: Wikipedia</p></div>

      <div class="desc"><h1>General Info</h1> <p>Located at a varying distance no closer than 63 million miles from the earth,
         Hoth is the sixth planet from the Sun in the Hoth System and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Jhas.
          In English Hoth carries a name of the Roman god of cold, and is often referred to as the "White Planet" because the
           snow prevalent on its surface gives it a whitish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies
           visible to the naked eye. Hoth is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent
           both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, and polar ice caps of Earth. Hoth can't easily be seen from
            Earth with the naked eye.</p> <p>Source: Wikipedia</p></div>
